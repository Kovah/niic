## About

The NIIC (NGU Idle Item Comparator) lets you compare two items from the game NGU Idle. Select two items from the item selector and the comparator will show you the statistics for both items side-by-side.
The item stats are calculated based on their maximum bonus when upgraded to level 100. Select two items for both slots and the comparator will show you which stats are better. In the selector you can filter by item type (head, chest, weapon,..), by set, or search by name.
